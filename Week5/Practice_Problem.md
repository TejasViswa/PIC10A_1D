Question 1: Write a program to write two functions:
sqrt_double: should return a double value, which would be square root of the value passed in as argument. The changes should be reflected in the value passed.                 
pow_double: should return a double value, which would be square of the value passed in as argument. The changes should be reflected in the value passed.

write a main function declares a starting point of x=5 and creates a random number based on the random number input either calls sqrt_double or pow_double ,
the function calls will terminate if the either value of x goes below 1.1 or if the value of x reaches more than 100.
