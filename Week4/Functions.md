Function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output.                                 
                                
The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function so that instead
of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.
**Why do we need functions?**
1)Functions help us in reducing code redundancy. If functionality is performed at multiple places in software, then rather than writing the same code, again and again, we create a function and call it everywhere. This also helps in maintenance as we have to change at one place if we make future changes to the functionality.       

2)Functions make code modular. Consider a big file having many lines of code. It becomes really simple to read and use the code if the code is divided into functions.
