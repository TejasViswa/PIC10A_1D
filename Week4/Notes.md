## Practice Problem 
Question 1: Write a program to take a intger as an input.                              
a)Write a function factorial which prints the factorial of the number.                        
Factorial of a number is the product of all integers beginning from 1 to the number. Example for 5 : 1*2*3*4*5=120
                                               
b)Write a function star which outputs a star which prints a triangle whose dimension is equal to length of the input.                             
Example the output for the input 5 will be.
