**Question 1:** Remember we can extract each character of the word in two ways. We can use characters or strings. 
```
string s="Mary";
string s1=s.substring(0,1);//give us M 
char s2=s[0] //gives us M
```
**Question 2:** Psuedocode Provided
```
Initialize both second smallest number(ss) and smallest number(s) to ..... (figure it out) 
Run a loop to find the smallest number. 
If you find the smallest number replace value of ss(second smallest) with s.
Replace value of s with the input(a). Continue till the end.......
There is a scenario here which you need to be careful about and will be discussed in class
```
