### Question 2
Question 1:a) Write a program to ask the user for an array size input (say n). Write a loop to take n inputs from the user. Check whether the number in the loop is a palindrome number or not. If it is a palindrome number store it in a seperate array and print the new array out. ( You can consider the size of the new array as n as well).

b) Take a two dimensional vector vv, take the first set of outputs in one row/column . Iterate through the outputs and check if number is odd/even , add all odd numbers in row 2 and all even numbers in row 3. 
```
Input: 
Size:5 
Please enter array elements: 121
34
56
232
