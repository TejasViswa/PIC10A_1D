Question 1: Write a program to ask the user for an array size input (say n). Write a loop to take n inputs from the user. Check whether the number in the loop is a palindrome number or not. If it is a palindrome number store it in a seperate array and print the new array out. ( You can consider the size of the new array as n as well).
