### Hint for Problem 1
The following diagram explains 4 numbers being sorted in ascending order. Please use this as reference and write a program to sort 5 numbers in descending order.

### Question for Problem 2
Write a program to take an integer input and check whether or not the number is a palendrome number or not.A palendrome is a number whose reverse is same as the original number. For Example: 121 is a palendrome number. 

Hints for Practice Problem:
What would you need for this question?  
We would need a loop since we do not know how many digits the number has.      
we would need to reverse the number and lastly  we would need to compare the reverse number from the original one.           

Hint: First try to extract digits, to reverse the digits you can simply mutiply with 10 in a looped manner. a%10= last digit of integer a. 234 is 4\*10, the number after two iterations of the loop would be is 400.  

This question helps you to understand how to add digits to a question, which will help in printing out the binary number. Solution shown in Monday's discussion section video. Solution will be given on Github after Tuesday's discussion. 



### Hint for Question 3
I found using cin.get() to check whether user gave'\n' to terminate the sequence very helpful.
